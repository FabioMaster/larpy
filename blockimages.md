# Input of image

# Generation of a random point

# Computation of the sub-image of a point

# Intersections of the 1D bar-charts of the point

# Computation of the 2D bar-charts

# Computation of the star-shaped 3D region of a point

# Weights of the occluding vertices of the star region

# Sorting of point pairs 

# Generation of block alternatives

# Choice of the best block

# Stamp of the block in the occluded image storage
